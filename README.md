build-monitor
=============

A simple little sinatra app that lets you use a mobile device as a build status board. This is just something I've quickly thrown together since I have an older android phone sitting around on my desk collecting dust.

If I wanted to be clever, I'd made the CI component pluggable but I have no need for that now. If anyone wants to submit a pull request with any improvements, you know what to do.
